        <h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>

If you submit any Personal Data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our Services, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <p>We will collect and use Personal Data when you voluntarily provide it to us, with the exception of your IP address and other user data that may be automatically captured when you access our Services. In order to use some portions of our Services, a user must first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will require disclosure of Personal Data. In addition, and in order to contact us by email, you must provide an email address.</p>
        
        <p>We automatically collect and aggregate certain Personal Data generated from your use of our Services, such as a unique identifier (unconnected to your account login information or IP address), and related analytics and usage information that we use to track usage of our Service, track trends in our data and Services, administer the Services, and improve our users’ experiences. When we aggregate such Personal Data, we do not combine these types of Personal Data with other non-aggregated Personal Data. If we do combine these two, we treat the data as Personal Data.</p>

We may share or sell aggregated Personal Data, demographic information, and other Services usage data with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers, and affiliates of the Company but prohibit use of such information for direct marketing. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of customers or clients utilizing our Services whose are located is in a certain geographic region. Or we might also inform a third party (that may or may not be promoting our Services on our behalf) that 45% of the users of our Services visit our website more than 3 times per week. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge them for this information.</p>

        <p>We will not disclose any information about your usage of our Services to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to enhance customer experience, service the legal agreement under which you are provided access to and the benefit of our Services or to meet our contractual obligations to third parties. Additionally, we also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data if we are required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information and/or data is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of the Company, its employees or contractors, customers, or the public.</p>

        <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact information provided above.</p>

        <h2>BUSINESS TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>Information that ValueCycle Health collects from our customers and clients, including Personal Data, is a business asset. If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of the our assets or equity, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g., due diligence), some or all of our assets, including your Personal Data, may be disclosed, shared or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ValueCycle Health or some or all of its assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p>ValueCycle Health has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that Personal Data we collect and process is secure.

As a reminder, if ValueCycle Health provides links to third-party websites, these websites may not have the same privacy policies as the Company. We are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our website.</p>

        <p>We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving Personal Data exchanged with our Services. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Data that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>When we disclose Personal Data as permitted under this Privacy Policy, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that Personal Data confidential and use only for performance of the contract, and not for any other purpose.</p>

        <p>It is important to us that the Personal Data we collect is appropriate and relevant to the purposes for which we intend to use it. ValueCycle Health will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data collected is relevant to its intended use. We understand that you may not want to let us use your Personal Data for purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which it originally was collected; therefore, we will use Personal Data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
