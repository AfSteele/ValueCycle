        <h2>Case Study: Oak Street Health</h2>
        <p>Oak Street Health’s Revenue Cycle Management team realized there was a gap between the HCC codes captured in clinical documentation and what was represented on return files from payers. OSH began the process of identifying, reconciling, and recovering value-based payments across multiple systems and payor contracts, which required significant time and resources when done manually. Over the course of 5+ years, Oak Street developed an Excel-based solution that delivered strong results for their internal revenue cycle operations, and the team believed greater efficiency could be achieved if incorporated into a software solution. OSH, Abundant Venture Partners, First Trust Capital Partners, and 121G collaborated on the product development for ValueCycle, which went into use at Oak Street Health this fall. </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Revenue cycle management (RCM) for value-based care has
                    multiple dimensions that traditional RCM systems fail to capture.
                    Variation amongst payer contracts, elongated reimbursement
                    timelines, and data complexities make it difficult to accurately
                    submit, predict, and reconcile payments with care rendered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process of capturing revenue associated with Hierarchical
                    Condition Category (HCC) Coding in particular is subject to
                    discrepancies as codes move from clinical documentation to
                    billing,
                    from billing to payers, and from payers to CMS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reconciliation of coding across these stakeholders in an arduous
                    process that is typically done manually and fraught with error.
                    It is estimated that providers lose 2-5% of revenue in this
                    process. This translates into substantial revenue left on the table
                    - for an organization with 50,000 covered lives, over $5M in
                    revenue could be lost each year.
